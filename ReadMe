There are roles: Client, Manager.
The client (authorized user) places orders from the menu - the catalog of dishes,
and also has the opportunity to view the catalog taking into account the sorting:
    - by the name of the dish;
    - by cost;
    - by category
    and filters the list of dishes by category. The customer, within one order, can order several identical dishes.
The manager manages the orders: after receiving a new order, sends it for cooking. After cooking,
the Manager passes the order for delivery. After delivery and receiving payment,
the Manager changes the status of the order to "completed".
